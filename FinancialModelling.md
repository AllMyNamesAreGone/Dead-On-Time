# Financial Modelling
The tool separates net worth into assets and liabilities, allowing for a more granular analysis of financial health. Different optimal asset allocations are prescribed for Super and non-Super funds, reflecting the distinct risks acceptance, characteristics and regulations of each. The modelling approach considers various factors, including spending flexibility, implicit wage growth, and the inclusion of the primary place of residence (PPOR) as a potential income-generating asset. There are uplifts and refinements of the models to improve accuracy and relevance in the pipeline.
