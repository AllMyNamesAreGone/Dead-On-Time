# Financial Modelling
The tool provides a comprehensive breakdown of net worth, distinguishing between assets & liabilities, thereby facilitating a nuanced analysis of financial well-being. It offers tailored asset allocation strategies for both Super & non-Super funds, accounting for their respective risk profiles, taxation frameworks, and investment objectives.

The modeling framework incorporates a range of critical variables, including expenditure flexibility, anticipated wage growth, and the potential income-generating capacity of non-productive assets. These factors are integrated to provide a holistic view of an individual's financial landscape, allowing for informed decision-making & strategic planning.

Ongoing enhancements & optimizations to the models are underway to enhance their accuracy & relevance, ensuring they remain robust in dynamic financial landscapes.
